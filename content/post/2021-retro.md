![A graphic with Brian's tournament results from the 2021 season.](/2021.png)
When I reflect on these results I am not entirely sure where to begin. My season was turbulent and I struggled to maintain consistency (mentally and physically). However, looking back on it now, I cannot deny how important this season was to me. It pushed me in ways that I have never been pushed before. It taught me lessons that I will be unpacking for the entire offseason and beyond. But I guess I should start from the beginning...

## Trouble at Whispering Falls

The opening event at Whispering Falls was one of the lowest points of my golfing journey. Not only did I come in next to last in my division, I lacked composure. I placed an overwhelming emphasis on outcome and could never mentally recover after poor shots. My prize for such behavior was a pair of sub 900 rounds. Interestingly, though, this event served as a catalyst to make a change. I was embarassed, not because of my score, but because of my conduct. Simply put, I was not a fun person to play with.

I realized a change had to be made, but I pivoted in the wrong direction. Throwing myself into rebuilding my physical approach to the game. The good news is this brought better results at the Cardinal, Lost River, and my first podium finish at Rhodes Grove. While I will acknowledge my form got better and I was throwing more consistently, I didn't see the writing on the wall. I didn't know it at the time, but I was setting myself up for failure. The physical game can only take you so far if you lack mental clarity. Meanwhile, Ditto was waiting...

## Dangers of Ditto

Here is the thing about Ditto Farms. It is one of those courses that demands fairway placement. You are going to take bogeys and bad things are going to happen to you. Period.

In hindsight, I shouldn't have be surprised that I lost my composure early in the first round. It was one of the only times in my journey that I considered withdrawing after the first round (that's how bad it was). I am glad I didnt becaiuse the second round went much better and I posted the third best round of my division. But that didn't change the fact that I needed to make another change.

This time, however, I made no mistake in identifying where the issue was. It had nothing to do with my equipment or how I was throwing. It had everything to do with my mental approach to the game. It took six events for me to make this realization. The realization that one of the most important aspects of a well rounded golf game had been woefully neglected: mental composure.

I reached out to my friend and coach <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ferretdance03/" target="_blank">Brad Lescalleet</a>. Not only is Brad a fierce competitor in the MPO field, he is also knowledgable of concepepts related to building a strong metal game. He was generous with his time and during our many chats, he shared numerous resources to get me started. These discussions and resources would build the foundation I needed to pivot (again). Not a moment too soon as I geared up for the GHO.

## The Pivot at GHO

Have you ever arrived at an event and something felt different? That is what happened to me going into the GHO. Something good was about to happen... and it did. Judging purely by results, it is tough to see. But, for the first time all year, I was in complete control of my game. From top to bottom, from physical execution to mental fortitude, I played my game.

It felt phenominal.

I was able to carry this momentum into Swover Creek. Interestingly, I did have a moment of anger and frustation in the second round (due to me falling during a putt). But here is the difference: it lasted one hole and then I recovered. From there, I pieced together one of my proudest performances for the season. It was then that I bought in... it was working. It was working for one simple reason: it allowed me to make mistakes by reducing the focus on the outcome. This is a topic that I intend on writing about in detail. For now, suffice it to say that by shifting my perspective, I performed better.

## The SHAG

The SHAG is my favorite tournament of the year. When I first started out, I was graciously accepted into a small league of people that played at this course regularly. It had a significant impact on my early development as a player. Interestingly, I have never performed well here. It has this way of luring me into traps that get me into trouble. Nevertheless, the SHAG has always served as my 'victory lap'. I did not place any emphasis on outcome and I didn't even have a real goal. I just wanted to relax and take it all in.

As is tradition, I did not play well but I had a wonderful time. My friend Mike had some extra sausages at lunch that we shared, I got a disc in my players pack that went right into the bag, and I got to play a track dear to my heart. It was a great day.
