![A graphic with Brian's tournament results from the 2021 season.](/2021.png)
When I reflect on these results I am not entirely sure where to begin. My season was turbulent. Full of change and not very much in the way of stability. However, looking back on it now, I cannot deny how important this season was to me. It pushed me in ways that I have never been pushed before. It taught me lessons that I will be unpacking for the entire offseason and beyond. But I guess I should start from the beginning...

The opening event in March at Whispering Falls was one of the lowest points of my golfing journey. Not only did I come in next to last in my division, I lacked any emotional control. I played as if it was the most important tournament of my life and could never mentally recover. My prize for such behavior was a pair of sub 900 rounds. Interestingly, though, this event served as a catalyst to make a change. I was embarassed, not because of my score, but because of my conduct. Simply put, I was not a fun person to play with.

I realized a change had to be made, but I pivoted in the wrong direction. Throwing myself into rebuilding my physical approach to the game. The good news is this brought better results at the Cardinal, Lost River, and my first podium finish at Rhodes Grove. While I will acknowledge my form got better and I was throwing further, I was not on the right track.

You see, in golf it is hard to implement new form changes mid season. It takes a long time for physical adjustments to stick. They last so long as you are playing well, but as soon as you aren't, you tend to revert to bad habits to compensate. This happened at Maurertown and Ditto.

Ditto was another one of these events that I was embarassed with. Again, not because of my play, but because I lost control. In the first round I was slamming chains and speed putting to simply expediate the event. It was one of the only times in my journey that I considered withdrawing after the first round. The second round went much better. I posted the third best round of my division.

This time, however, I made no mistake in identifying where the issue was. It had nothing to do with my equipment or how I was throwing. It had everything to do with my mental approach to the game. It took six events for me to make this realization. The realization that one of the most important aspects of a well rounded golf game was woefully neglected: emotional control.

I reached out to my friend and coach <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ferretdance03/" target="_blank">Brad Lescalleet</a>. Not only is Brad a fierce competitor in the MPO field, he is also knowledgable of concepepts related to building a strong metal game. He was generous with his time and during our many chats, he shared numerous resources to get me started. These discussions and resources would build the foundation I needed to pivot (again). Not a moment too soon as I geared up for the GHO.
